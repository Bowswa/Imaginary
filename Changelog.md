## Removals
Some mod removals will be due to these mods being for content creators, and will be removed from the modpack by default to help reduce load.

- Removed "Just Enough Items" due to massive amount of lag loading a world
- Removed "First Person Model" due to incompatability with VR
- Removed "Replay Mod" & "Replay Voice Chat" to reduce modpack load.
- TEMPORARY removal of "The Immersive Music Mod" as it was incompatible with Reactive Music.
  - This mod will remain disabled, however the music files will be integrated into a custom songpack for the Imaginary Modpack for compatability.
- Removed "OBS Overlay" to reduce modpack load
- Removed "Not Enough Recipe Book" due to the removal of "Just Enough Items". I am looking for a better solution though.

## Fixes

- Fixed two music tracks playing at once when in a world(incompatability between The Immersive Music Mod & Reactive Music)
