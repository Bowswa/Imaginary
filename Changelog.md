# Imaginary VR v1.2.1

## Install Instructions

1. Please use 5+ GB of RAM(may be more, this is untested on my part. I will do even more testing to find the lowest possible in the next update.)
2. You will need to use a custom java argument, failure to do so may result in performance loss: ```-XX:+UseZGC```
