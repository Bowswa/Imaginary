<h3>Updates:</h3>

- Updated to 1.21
- Since 0.0.8c, pack development was put on hold for a while. In this time the scope of the project has changed, and now also includes
  a VR version. Updates may not be frequent, and the pack may use more mods now.
  - Due to this, I started from scratch. However, this still feels closer to Beta releases than ever.
