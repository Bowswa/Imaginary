# Introduction Into Imaginary

Imaginary is a hand picked collection of datapacks, with minimal mods, to enhance your gameplay experience.

**IMAGINARY IS IN ALPHA!!! BUGS MAY ARISE, WORLDS MAY STOP WORKING AFTER AN UPDATE, AND NOT ALL FEATURES ARE INTEGRATED IN THEIR FINAL FORM OR AT ALL!!!**

**5/9/2024 - Update 0.0.8c is OUT!**
**This update brings all packs and mods up to date while you wait for 0.0.9!**
**Update 0.0.9 is planned to be in 1.20.5, and be one that focuses on polishing, bugs fixes, and preparing to enter beta v0.1.X development.**

### Imagine the World

When you imagine a perfect minecraft world, what does it look like? Imaginary aims to bring that perfect world into your game. Using a vanilla like feel, welcome yourself into the closest possible representation of that perfect, or imaginary, world.

With 3+ new boss fights, countless new biomes, many new custom items, new mobs, harder mechanics, and even a couple new dimensions, exploring your world just became an Imaginary experience. Unlock everything with many new advancements, including some lore to follow! Or not, if you don't like that kinda thing.

Make this world your version of an Imaginary world!<br><br><br>
